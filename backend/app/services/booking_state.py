"""One active booking intent per call: draft -> confirmed -> persisted.

The duplicate-appointment bug this module exists to kill came from treating
*intent detection* as the trigger to write. The agent booked the moment a date
was heard, so "September 20" created an appointment and "actually, make it the
22nd" created a second one, after which the final confirmation tripped over the
first and told the caller the slot was already taken.

The model here separates three things that were previously conflated:

  draft      the caller's current wish. Mutable, overwritten in place every
             time they change their mind, and never written to a calendar.
  intent     one booking the caller is trying to make. Identified by
             `booking_id`, which survives any number of draft edits and only
             rotates when the caller explicitly asks for a *separate*
             appointment.
  persisted  the appointment row and provider event backing an intent. At most
             one per intent, enforced by a unique index on
             `appointments.booking_intent_key`.

So changing the date edits the draft (before persistence) or moves the existing
event (after it). Neither path can produce a second appointment, because the
key that identifies the row is derived from the intent, not from the date.

Confirmation is deliberately decided here rather than in a prompt: a model told
"don't book twice" still books twice. `is_affirmative` gives the state machine
a caller-side signal it can check itself.

# `_authoritative_reply`, looks_like_unverified_booking_success) stops
# the agent from ever claiming a booking is confirmed unless a persisted
# appointment backs it. This is the availability-side counterpart: it stops
# the agent from claiming a SPECIFIC time is open/available/free/offered
# unless that exact time is something a real provider round-trip actually
# returned for this call. Business hours are not availability, and being
# inside opening hours never implies a therapist is free.
#
# The authoritative source is `BookingDraft.selected_slot` /
# `alternative_slots`, which are populated exclusively from
# `AvailabilityVerdict.slot` — itself populated exclusively by a real
# provider search (see `SquareAdapter.check_availability`). Nothing here
# computes or guesses a time; it only decides whether the agent's own words
# are backed by that state.
