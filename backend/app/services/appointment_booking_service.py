"""
Converts an extracted AppointmentIntent into real Appointment/Contact records,
with conflict detection. Designed to be called mid-conversation: the resulting
BookingResult.to_system_message() is injected into CallSession history so the
NEXT Grok reply naturally confirms/denies the booking to the caller.

Two things decide where a booking lands, and neither is under the caller's
control:

  * the `TenantScope` carried by the call (spa tenant vs 6DM sales workspace),
    which fixes the rows this transaction may read and write;
  * the `BookingAdapter` chosen from the call direction, which fixes the
    external calendar it is mirrored into.

An inbound spa conversation therefore cannot reach Dominic's calendar, and one
spa's receptionist cannot see another spa's diary.
