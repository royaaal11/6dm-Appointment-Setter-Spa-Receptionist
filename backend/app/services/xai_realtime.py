"""
Drives one xAI realtime voice session for an inbound SIP call.

Inbound calls on a number attached to a Twilio Elastic SIP trunk pointed at
sip.voice.x.ai never reach the <Gather> webhooks in app/api/v1/telephony.py —
the trunk overrides the number's voice_url. xAI instead POSTs a
`realtime.call.incoming` webhook, and the call only becomes a conversation once
something connects to the realtime WebSocket for that call_id and configures it.

This module is that something. Per call it:
  1. opens wss://api.x.ai/v1/realtime?call_id=...
  2. sends `session.update` with the tenant's persona, voice and tool schema
  3. speaks the greeting immediately, so the caller is not met with silence
  4. services `manage_appointment` tool calls through the existing booking engine
  5. accumulates both sides of the conversation and persists the transcript,
     summary and status onto the same CallLog row the <Gather> flow writes

Event-name coverage is deliberately tolerant. The wire contract here is taken
from xAI's published SIP/Voice Agent docs rather than from live traffic, so each
handler accepts the documented name plus near-neighbour spellings, and anything
unrecognised is logged at debug under `_UNHANDLED` instead of being dropped
silently. Tighten this once real sessions have been observed.
