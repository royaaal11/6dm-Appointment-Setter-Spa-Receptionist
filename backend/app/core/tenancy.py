"""Row-level scoping for the multi-tenant engine.

Every tenant-owned table (contacts, appointments, call_logs) carries a nullable
`tenant_id`:

  * `tenant_id IS NULL`  -> the 6DM sales workspace, owned by a super admin user
                            via `owner_id` / `user_id`.
  * `tenant_id = <uuid>` -> that spa. Rows here have no owning user, because the
                            AI receptionist creates them with no human involved.

`TenantScope` is the single object that decides which of those a request may
touch. Routers build one via `app.api.deps.get_tenant_scope` and pass it to
`scope_filter()` on read and `scope_columns()` on write, so a missing filter is
a visible omission rather than a silent cross-tenant leak.
